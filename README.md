# Bitminers
The project is built upon the opensource miner Xilinx port available at https://github.com/progranism/Open-Source-FPGA-Bitcoin-Miner.git
Open source bitminer supports Digilent Nexys2 board with a Spartan 3E 500K.
We are in the process of testing open source miner on Spartan 6 board with updated User constraints file.
